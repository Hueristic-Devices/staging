This is a resupply kit for your ProWater Drinking Water test kit. 

 

Every time you reorder a new set of reagents, you must recalibrate your smartphone. To help you do this, the resupply kit packs a set of calibration reagents and set of instructions. Please note, when you recalibrate, you are basically providing your smartphone with a colour-and-contaminant-concentration directory. The results of the ensuing tests will be as accurate as the directory, so please follow calibration instructions faithfully. Wash instruments with distilled water to eliminate contamination; measure exactly to get good calibration results.

 

Your resupply kit  should contain the following components

*Calibration standards for each parameter

*Reagents for each parameter

*Measuring instruments for reagents


 

_Resupply kit only includes calibration standards, reagents and measuring instruments such as test tubes and spatulas. It does not come with a kit bag or smartphone_
