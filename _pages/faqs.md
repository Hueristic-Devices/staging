### General queries

#### What kind of water sources can I use the kit to test with?

Any water source can be tested as long as the water sample is clear, colourless, and the concentration of the parameter you are testing for falls within the range of the test.

#### Will the apps work with iPhones?

The apps only work on Android phones

#### Can I put back excess  distilled water if I measure out too much?

Ideally it would be preferable to throw away the excess distilled water as there is a chance of contamination.

#### Tips and troubleshooting for HD Pro

**No match?**

If you are getting a ‘No match’ message after doing your test, it means that the color that your sample is presenting is not within the range of the calibration for that parameter. This usually occurs when

**Your reagent has expired.** Make sure to check the expiry date on the reagent bottle before testing

**You have started using a new reagent without calibrating your phone first.** Click [here](url) for a tutorial on how to calibrate your device


**Wrong results**

Wrong results could occur for four different reasons
**Incorrect measurement.** Change in measurements of either water sample, reagents or can show up as wrong results. Make sure you measure accurately before testing.

**Contamination of the water sample.** Make sure you wash your apparatus well with distilled water before and after a test.

**Old version of the app.** Make sure you are working with the latest version of the HD elementary app.

**Expired reagents.** Reagents that are past their expiry date can cause changes in the colour of the sample which can lead to a change in results. Make sure to check the expiry date on the reagent bottle before testing.



#### Tips and troubleshooting for HD Elementary


**What are the ideal lighting conditions to conduct a HD Elementary test?**

Ideally, the test should be conducted in an area amply lit with direct sunlight, with the color card stand facing the direction of the sunlight.

**No match?**

If you are getting a ‘No match’ message after doing your test, it means that the color that your sample is presenting is not within the range of the calibration for that parameter. This usually occurs when 

**Your reagent has expired.** Make sure to check the expiry date on the reagent bottle before testing

**You have started using a new reagent without calibrating your phone first.** Click [here](url) for a tutorial on how to calibrate your device

**you are not testing in a well lit area.** Make sure to test in an area with ample direct sunlight and place your stand facing the direction of the sunlight

**How to scan the colour card?**

**The color card isn't getting read**

In the default ‘Automatic capture mode’ that the app comes with, the app is trained to read the color card in the optimum conditions of brightness. Try moving to a better lit area or an area with direct sunlight to improve lighting conditions.
  
If the card is still not getting read, go to the menu on the top left hand corner of the homepage and click on Settings >> Turn on ‘Manual photo capture’.

This allows you to manually take a picture of the colour card instead of waiting for the app to read it automatically

( NOTE: The readings taken with ‘Manual capture’ could show a slight variation as compared to those taken with ‘Automatic capture’)
