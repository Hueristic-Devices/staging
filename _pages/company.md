<br>Hueristic Devices hallmark is innovation and resourcefulness. We create practical test data collection and data use solutions, based on tried and tested scientific methods,  for helping customers take informed action on resource quality. We are a Bengaluru-based organization. We were registered in December 2019, just before the lockdown year. But we are old in research and development. Look up the non-profit called Foundation for Environmental Monitoring (ffem), with an open source philosophy, started in 2016,  after its split (as Tern Up) from Akvo and brand Caddisfly, to set up its own systems in India. Hueristic Devices is the for-profit entity established to market testing products and sustain ffem research on environment and environment-related information.
 
<br>The name Hueristic derives from the word 'heuristic' and the fact that we make colorimetric tests--that is, our business is reading colours and hues and interpret what this says about the chemical composition of the sample being tested. Therefore 'hue', and Hueristic Devices. A heuristic is a problem-solving method; it is also a philosophy, a way of doing. The objective of a heuristic is to produce a good enough solution to solve a problem at hand, in an reasonable, actionable time frame.
 
<br>The 'heuristic' philosophy is reflected in our product design. Hueristic Devices products are designed to be simple to use anywhere, at any time, without having to make the effort of going to a lab. Hueristic Devices products and R&D are aimed towards making testing as simple as possible to encourage more people to test and act on science-based test information.
