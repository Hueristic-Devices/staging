Hueristic Devices makes measuring simple to enable timely, appropriate action on processes that impact environment, health and livelihoods. We are a Bengaluru-based organization that makes app-based testing and software to manage test data flow and access, data visualization and analysis. Our products are useful to industries, governments, environmental agencies and researchers working on resource quality management. Our aim is to help individuals and organizations do business as if the environment matters.

 

 Hueristic Deviced Pvt Ltd was registered in December 2019. Our sister research organization is a non-profit called Foundation for Environmental Monitoring (ffem).

 

Our philosophy is reflected in our name. The objective of a heuristic is to produce a good enough solution to solve a problem at hand, in an reasonable, actionable time frame. It is a problem-solving method; a way of doing, which we feel is particularly apt in acting on issues related to environment quality governance for sustainable water, soil and air quality. Our products reflect this philosophy. They are designed to help users take timely action on resource quality in the simplest ways possible.
