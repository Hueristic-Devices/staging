Hueristic Devices makes measuring simple to enable timely, appropriate action on processes that impact environment, health and livelihoods. We are a Bengaluru-based organization that offers digitized testing and test data management solutions. Our aim is to help individuals and organizations do business as if the environment matters. 

Hueristic Deviced Pvt Ltd was registered in December 2019. Our sister research organization is a non-profit called Foundation for Environmental Monitoring (ffem).

Our philosophy drives our innovations and research and is reflected in our name. The objective of a heuristic is to produce a good enough solution to solve a problem, in a reasonable, actionable time frame. A hueristic is a problem-solving method; a way of doing, which we feel is particularly apt for acting on issues related to environment quality governance for sustainable water, soil and air quality. Our products are designed to help users understand enough about the status of resource quality, in the simplest and most time-efficient ways, to make timely action possible.
