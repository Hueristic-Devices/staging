Hueristic Devices is a a Bengaluru-based organization that believes that good quality air, water and soil is the responsibility of every citizen--industrial, corporate, agricultural and individual. We make water and soil testing equipment, and software solutions to share and interpret test data better.



We make measuring simple to enable timely, appropriate action on processes that impact environment, health and livelihoods. Our aim is to help individuals and organizations do business as if the environment matters.



We were registered in December 2019, just before the lockdown year. But we are old in research and development. Look up the non-profit called Foundation for Environmental Monitoring (ffem), with an open source philosophy, started in 2016,  after its split (as Tern Up) from Akvo and brand Caddisfly, to set up its own systems in India. Hueristic Devices is the for-profit entity established to market testing products and sustain ffem research on environment and open environment-related data.



The name 'Hueristic' derives from the word 'heuristic' and the fact that we make colorimetric tests--that is, our business is reading colours and hues as accurately as we can and interpret what this says about the chemical composition of the sample being tested. Therefore 'hue', and Hueristic Devices. A heuristic is a problem-solving method; it is a philosophy, a way of doing. The objective of a heuristic is to produce a good enough solution to solve a problem at hand, in an reasonable, actionable time frame.



The 'heuristic' philosophy is reflected in our product design. Hueristic Devices products are designed to be simple to use anywhere, at any time, without having to make the effort of going to a lab, so as to encourage timely corrective action. Hueristic Devices products and R&D are aimed towards making testing as simple as possible to encourage more people to test and act on this science-based test information.



Hueristic Devices makes ‘good measures’, for the environment, possible.
